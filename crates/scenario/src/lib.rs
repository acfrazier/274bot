//! Shared scenario layer: one scenario, two runners.
//!
//! A scenario is a seed (which profiles to log in, mainland hop), a
//! sequence of run steps (each an action send plus the evidence it must
//! produce within a tick budget), and a proof predicate over the terminal
//! `GameSnapshot` — the same observable state scripts and the host read.
//! The headed runner (`panel-play --live script_<name>`) and the headless
//! runner (`crates/e2e` under `LIVE=1`) drive the same
//! [`ScenarioRunner`], so both pass/fail identically. The PASS/FAIL
//! contract replaces the old "5 Running polls" `LiveScript` stub: a
//! scenario proves real game state, not that a poll loop ran.
//!
//! Waiting names evidence, not sleeps (the 377 harness pattern): a step
//! sends once, then waits `budget_ticks` game ticks for a named predicate
//! on the evolving snapshot. Each runner pumps the machine from its own
//! per-frame hook (the panel slot thread headed, the `run_with_io` hook
//! headless), so no thread sleeps inside the shared layer.
